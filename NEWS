     all are now used via difR package
  o  Delta plots were extended: 
     fixed and normal threshold are now allowed
  o  Multiple comparison correction methods were added

        - 'DistractorAnalysis()' function and its graphical 
           representation 'plotDistractorAnalysis()'. 
        - 'plotDIFirt()' and 'plotDIFLogistic()' functions for 
           plotting characteristic curves based on IRT models
           and based on logistic regression.
