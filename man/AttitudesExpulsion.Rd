\description{
Dataset from Kolek et al. (2021) study investigating a video game's effects
on implicit and explicit attitudes towards depicted historical events in the
short- and long-term. As an intervention tool, a serious game
\emph{Czechoslovakia 38–89: Borderlands} was utilized that deals with the
expulsion of the Sudeten Germans from the former Czechoslovakia after the
WWII. Data consists responses from 145 adults from two groups (experimental
and control group) on number of multi-item measurements.
