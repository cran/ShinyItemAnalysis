\title{Graphical representation of difficulty and (generalized) discrimination in item analysis}
\usage{
DDplot(data, item.names, k = 3, l = 1, u = 3)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{numeric: binary data matrix or data frame. See \strong{Details}.}

\item{item.names}{character: the names of items.}

\item{k}{numeric: number of groups to which may be data.frame x divided by the total score.
Default value is 3.  See \strong{Details}.}

\item{l}{numeric: lower group. Default value is 1. See \strong{Details}.}

\item{u}{numeric: upper group. Default value is 3. See \strong{Details}.}
}
\description{
Plots difficulty and (generalized) discrimination for items ordered by difficulty.
}
\details{
The \code{data} is a matrix or data frame whose rows represents examinee answers
("1" correct, "0" incorrect) and columns correspond to the items. The \code{item.names}
argument stands for names of items. If not specified, the names of dataset columns are used.
Generalized discrimination is computed as follows: The function takes data on individuals,
computes their total test score and then divides individuals into \code{k} groups. The lower and
upper group are determined by \code{l} and \code{u} parameters, i.e.  l-th and u-th group where
the ordering is defined by increasing total score.
}
\note{
Generalized discrimination is calculated by \code{\link{gDiscrim}} function, generalized version
of \code{\link{discrim}} function in \code{psychometric} package.

\examples{
\dontrun{
# loading 100-item medical admission test data set
data(dataMedical)
data <- dataMedical[, 1:100]

# Difficulty/Discrimination plot of dataMedical data set
DDplot(data)

# Difficulty/Discrimination plot of dataMedical data set
# discrimination based on 5 groups, comparing 4th and 5th
DDplot(data, k = 5, l = 4, u = 5)
